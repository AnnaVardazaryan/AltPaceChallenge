# **Titanic Survival Prediction Project**


**Overview:**
This project involves predicting survival outcomes using machine learning models on the Titanic dataset.
The project explores and analyzes the dataset, building and comparing machine learning models, namely the MLPClassifier and the Keras Sequential model.

**Dataset Description:**

The Titanic dataset contains several features that provide information about passengers on the Titanic and their journey. Here's a brief description of each feature:

**1.Pclass (Passenger Class)**: The class of the ticket purchased by the passenger (1st, 2nd, or 3rd class).

**2.Sex**: The gender of the passenger (male or female).

**3.Age**: The age of the passenger.

**4.SibSp (Siblings/Spouses Aboard)**: The number of siblings or spouses traveling with the passenger.

**5.Parch (Parents/Children Aboard)**: The number of parents or children traveling with the passenger.

**6.Fare**: The amount of money paid for the ticket.

**7.Embarked**: The port at which the passenger boarded the ship (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

**Workflow**

**1.Data Loading**: Dataset was obtained from Kaggle.

**2.Data Exploration**: Undertook preliminary data exploration to understand the nature and structure of the data.

**3.Data Cleaning**: Identified and treated missing values and checked for duplicates.

**4.Data Visualization**: Used histogram plots to understand the distribution of features. 

**5.Modeling**: Trained both MLPClassifier and Keras Sequential models.

**6.Evaluation**: Assessed model performance using metric such as accuracy.

**7.Conclusion**: Summarized key findings and determined the best performing model based on the evaluation metrics.

**Requirements:**

Python 3.x
